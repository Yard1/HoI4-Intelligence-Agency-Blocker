Intelligence Agency Blocker modding utility by Yard1 (HoI4 Modding Coop resource).

Just drag and drop everything to your folder and change the can_create_intelligence_agency scripted trigger in common/scripted_triggers/intelligence_agency_blocker_trigger.txt as you desire. Will block both player (by making the button unclickable) and AI (by an AI strategy reducing the number of factories AI can use for intelligence way below 0). Will not block create_intelligence_agency = yes effect.

You may want to make copies of localisation/intelligence_agency_blocker_l_english.yml for other languages your mod supports.

Feel free to use in your mods with credit to Yard1 in code and on the download page.
